          "Jesus speaks these words on the eve of His betrayal, knowing full well the cross is near. And yet, He chooses to talk about fruit-bearing and abiding. Why? Because He’s not just preparing His disciples for His departure — He’s preparing them for spiritual productivity in His absence.\n\nTo “abide” means to remain, dwell, or stay connected with unwavering consistency. We live in a world of constant distractions — social media, pressure to perform, instant gratification — and yet Jesus says: “Apart from Me, you can do nothing.”\n\nThis isn’t poetic exaggeration. He means it.\nFruitfulness isn’t about trying harder — it’s about staying connected.\n\nAre you striving in your own strength?\nAre you measuring your value by what you produce?\nHave you mistaken spiritual activity for spiritual intimacy?\n\nThe Father is not impressed by leaves. He desires fruit — and that fruit only grows when you’re deeply rooted in Christ’s love, His Word, and His Spirit. Let Him prune what’s unproductive. Pruning is painful, but it’s proof that you are connected and loved.",

But God calls you to walk by faith, not by sight.\n\nThis chapter also touches on other profound truths:\n\n• Discipline is love: God corrects those He loves.\n• Generosity leads to abundance: Honor God with your wealth, not just your worship.\n• Wisdom brings peace: Divine wisdom isn’t just smart — it’s safe, life-giving, and peaceful.\n\nLet today be a day where you surrender logic for obedient trust.",
